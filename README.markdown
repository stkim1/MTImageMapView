# MTImageMapView

An UIImageView subclass to select a complex polygon map out of many.<br/>
Extremely useful for handling touches on, for example, Europe map, or an eye of owl.

[![MTImageMapView Demo](http://img.youtube.com/vi/Fnnz6DiGBb0/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnnz6DiGBb0&vq=hd720)  

## Features

- Handling multiple maps on an image.<sup>1</sup> 
- Multiple MTImageMapView on a single view
- Support Interface Builder, or progmatical initiation
- Batch mapping. <sup>2</sup> 
- Completion block for notifying the end of mapping.<sup>3</sup> 
- Delegate to provide selected map index
- Single public class and protocol to implement
- Debug mode to superimpose maps on an image

<ol>
	<li>There is no limit but you need to be reasonable. In this example, I put around 50.</li>
	<li>Mapping takes place in background and prevents UI animation from stuttering.</li>
	<li>At the end of mapping, mapping function notifies on main thread.</li>
</ol>

## Support

- XCode 4.4 or higher required.
- Works on iOS 4.3 ~ iOS 6.0 ARC/MRC (tested on devices.)
- Starting from iOS 6.0, dispatch objects are Object-C objects, meaning when you are to go with ARC, dispatch objects too are managed by ARC. You can read more detail at [Does ARC support dispatch queues?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8618632/does-arc-support-dispatch-queues) <br/>
 This paricular issue is solved with <code>OS_OBJECT_USE_OBJC</code> flag. You can read more in detail at [OMG, GCD+ARC](http://www.cocoanetics.com/2013/01/omg-gcdarc/)

## Implementation
1. Use tools like [Gimp](http://www.gimp.org/) and generate a image map.
2. Copy only coordinate pairs of the map (e.g. "123,242,452,242,142,322") in NSString type.
3. Put the strings in an NSArray.
4. Instantiate MTImageMapView and implement MTImageMapDelegate procotol
5. pass the array to the map view.
   (You can use .plist to pass a map batch to a MTImageMapView. )

```objective-c
    MTImageMapView *viewImageMap =\
        [[MTImageMapView alloc]
         initWithImage:
            [UIImage imageNamed:@"sample_image.png"]
         ];

    [viewImageMap setDelegate:self];
    [self.view addSubview:viewImageMap];
    
    NSArray *arrStates = \
        [NSArray arrayWithObjects:
         @"542,94,568,94,568,111,542,111"
         @"555,150,574,150,574,161,555,161"
         @"535,149,551,149,551,159,535,159"
         ,nil];

    [viewImageMap
     setMapping:arrStates
     doneBlock:^(MTImageMapView *imageMapView) {
         NSLog(@"Mapping complete!");
     }];
```

```objective-c
	-(void)imageMapView:(MTImageMapView *)inImageMapView
	   didSelectMapArea:(NSUInteger)inIndexSelected
	    areaCentrePoint:(CGPoint)point
	{
	    [[[[UIAlertView alloc]
	     initWithTitle:@"*** State Name ***"
	     message:[stateNames objectAtIndex:inIndexSelected]
	     delegate:nil
	     cancelButtonTitle:@"Ok"
	     otherButtonTitles:nil]
	      autorelease] show];
	}
```
### LIMITS
- Delegate only receives the index of a map.
- Coordinates must be provided in pairs.
- At least 3 pairs of coordinates must be presented.
- No "rect", "circle" type map is supported. "Polygon" only at this time being.
